## Rock Paper & Scissors
***

Our 2nd solo exercise building on **Html**, **CSS** and **JavaScript** combined.

***

### What?
***
Build a simple Rock paper & scissors game with html css and Javascript.
### Expected functional result:
***
1. Phase 1

* The player should have 3 buttons to click for his choice.
* When the player presses the 4th play button, his choice should be compared to the computers randomly generated choice.
* The player see whether he has won or lost the game, else it will show a draw.
* The result is shown within the HTML, not in an alert box.

2. Phase 2

* The player has the option to view his score so far. (optional)
* The player has the option to reset his score or restart the game/play again.
* The result (or its styling) may change upon different score (win, lose or draw).

3. Nice-to-have features:

* Nice graphics, spend some time on a well rounded and nice looking UI.
* Score keeping (see Phase 2).
* Add extra options (not just rock paper & scissors).
* Highlight the correct button during and/or after pressing the play button.
